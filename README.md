# 🏆 Sports Intelligence Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot agent built for the **AI Agent Development Internship Coding Challenge**.  
This is an **"Ask Me Anything" expert system** for a specific sport (e.g., Football/Soccer), capable of answering a wide range of questions by leveraging a **local knowledge base** through a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**.

The agent autonomously classifies user queries and decides the best strategy to retrieve relevant information before generating a contextually accurate response.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The chatbot operates on a **RAG pipeline**, which allows the LLM to access and use external knowledge before generating a response.  
This prevents hallucination and ensures answers are based on factual data provided in the knowledge base.

**Workflow:**

1. **Knowledge Base Ingestion** – Documents (PDF, TXT, MD) from the `data/sports_knowledge_base/` directory are loaded and split into smaller, manageable chunks.
2. **Vector Embeddings** – Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using a Hugging Face sentence-transformer model.
3. **Vector Store** – Embeddings are stored in a **FAISS vector database** for efficient similarity searches.
4. **User Query** – Users ask a question via the **Streamlit interface**.
5. **Query Classification** – The "Decision Engine" classifies the query (Factual, Comparative, Analytical, Non-Sport).
6. **Strategic Retrieval** – Based on classification, the engine retrieves relevant chunks from FAISS.
7. **Context Augmentation** – Retrieved chunks + query are merged into a detailed prompt.
8. **Response Generation** – The prompt is sent to a local LLM (e.g., Flan-T5) to generate the final response.
9. **Graceful Handling** – If query is "Non-Sport," the chatbot politely declines.

**Pipeline Flow:**

```
[User Query] -> [Query Classifier] -> [Decision Engine] -> [RAG Strategy] -> [Vector Store]
      ^                                                                         |
      |                                                                         v
[Final Answer] <- [LLM Generation] <- [Prompt Augmentation] <- [Retrieved Documents]
```

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+  
- pip (Python package installer)  

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sport_bot.git
cd sport_bot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**macOS/Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.env\Scriptsctivate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1. Add Your Knowledge Base
Place your **sports-related documents (PDF, TXT, MD)** inside:
```
data/sports_knowledge_base/
```

⚠️ Must contain at least **one document** for the chatbot to work.

---

### 2. Build the Vector Store
```bash
python -m src.vector_store
```
This generates a `vector_store/` directory with the FAISS index.  
Re-run if you **add, remove, or modify** documents.

---

### 3. Launch the Chatbot
```bash
streamlit run demo.py
```

This opens the chatbot interface in your web browser. ✅

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **Local LLM (`google/flan-t5-small`)** – Runs on standard laptops with ≤ 8GB RAM. Instruction-tuned for better RAG performance.  
- **Keyword-Based Query Classifier** – Simple rule-based system, fast and reliable.  
- **Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)** – Balance of speed and embedding quality.  
- **FAISS Vector Store** – High-speed similarity search without requiring a full DB server.  
- **Streamlit UI** – Quick and user-friendly chat interface.
